<h1>Analyze a vulnerable system for a small business</h1>

### [YouTube Demonstration (work in progress)](https://youtu.be/URL)


<h2>Description</h2>

<p><em>This scenario was completed during the Google Cybersecurity Certificate Program:</em></p>

You are a newly hired cybersecurity analyst for an e-commerce company. The company stores information on a remote database server, since many of the employees work remotely from locations all around the world. Employees of the company regularly query, or request, data from the server to find potential customers. The database has been open to the public since the company's launch three years ago. As a cybersecurity professional, you recognize that keeping the database server open to the public is a serious vulnerability.

A vulnerability assessment of the situation can help you communicate the potential risks with decision makers at the company. You must create a written report that clearly explains how the vulnerable server is a risk to business operations and how it can be secured.
